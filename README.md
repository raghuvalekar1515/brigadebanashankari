# Brigade Banashankari

Static website for Brigade Banashankari, a pre-launch apartment community by Brigade in
Uttarahalli, South Bengaluru. Built on the Ira Moonglade Webflow
template, served from Cloudflare Workers, with lead capture to KV plus email,
Telegram and the shared Google Sheet.

> **Built against `CLAUDE.md`**, the standing microsite checklist: no RERA wording
> anywhere, no source attribution, Brigade's palette and type (self-hosted under

> `Project Name`, `Zone` and `lead_source` fields on every form, the 8-second pop-up,
> the Bengaluru sibling list in the FAQ, and no em dashes anywhere in the copy.

> **THE FONT IS A STAND-IN.** brigadegroup.com sets every page in Proxima Nova, a

The design is the PNZ microsite template's, moved from its Webflow export to
Bootstrap 6 with the look unchanged (Bootstrap 6, below). Its copy, pictures,
logo and palette are this project's, generated from one facts file.

```
site/            The website. The only directory served.
  *.html         13 pages
  robots.txt sitemap.xml   crawler files
  css/bootstrap.min.css  Bootstrap 6, trimmed to the classes the pages use
  css/site.css   the site's design, on Bootstrap's tokens
  fonts/         the self-hosted fonts
  images/        pictures: WebP, narrower copies for phones, AVIF twins
  js/bootstrap.min.js  Bootstrap's Drawer plugin (the menu on phones and tablets)
  js/form-handler.js   posts the contact form to /api/lead
worker/
  index.js       lead endpoint; everything else falls through to site/
  test.mjs       68 assertions, no dependencies
tools/
  assets.mjs     rebuilds the two Bootstrap files (not part of the deploy)
wrangler.jsonc   bindings and deploy config
```

Keeping `worker/` outside `site/` is structural, not cosmetic: nothing but
`site/` is ever served, so Worker source can never be fetched however the repo
grows later.

---

## Bootstrap 6

The pages were moved from their Webflow export to Bootstrap 6 (`6.0.0-alpha.1`,
the only v6 release so far) on 12 November 2026, with the design unchanged:
every page was compared with the Webflow version at 1440, 1000, 768 and 390 px
wide, element by element, and the menu, FAQs, contact form and pop-up were
checked to behave and send leads exactly as before.

- **Markup.** Bootstrap's navbar with its drawer for the menu (in the bar from
  992 px, the template's breakpoint; a drawer below that, with a copy of the bar
  at its top so it opens as the Webflow menu did), `grid` for the layout grids,
  `<details>`/`<summary>` accordions (`accordion-item`) for the FAQs,
  `btn-solid theme-primary` buttons, `form-control` fields and Bootstrap
  alerts' `hidden` pattern for the thank-you and error messages
  (`data-lead-form`, `.lead-form_done`, `.lead-form_fail`). The template's
  own class names stay beside Bootstrap's and carry the design.
- **CSS.** `css/bootstrap.min.css` is Bootstrap's compiled CSS trimmed to the
  classes the pages use. `css/site.css` holds the site's design in the
  `custom` cascade layer Bootstrap reserves for it: the fonts, Bootstrap's
  `--bs-*` tokens pointed at the palette, the element defaults the pages were
  designed on, the template's rules, and Bootstrap's components in that design.
  It replaces `normalize.css`, `webflow.css` and the export's own stylesheet.
- **JavaScript.** `js/bootstrap.min.js` is Bootstrap's Drawer plugin, deferred.
  jQuery and webflow.js are gone. `form-handler.js` is the Bootstrap version
  shared with the newer microsites (same fields, same endpoint).

After adding a Bootstrap class that no page used before, rebuild the trimmed
files:

```sh
cd tools && npm install && node assets.mjs ../site
```

## Architecture

```
Browser ──▶ Cloudflare Worker
              ├── POST /api/lead        → validate → KV → notify (email, Telegram, Google Sheet)
              ├── GET  /api/lead/status → which channels are configured
              └── everything else       → static assets from ./site
```

One Worker. No server, no database, no build step - the HTML is committed as
built.

The order inside the endpoint is the whole design:

```js
await env.LEADS.put(key, JSON.stringify(record));   // 1. store first
ctx.waitUntil(Promise.all([notifyTelegram(), notifyEmail()]));  // 2. notify, not awaited
return json(200, { ok: true });                     // 3. respond
```

The lead is durable **before** any notification is attempted, and notification
is never awaited. A revoked token, an unverified address or a provider outage
costs a notification, never the enquiry.

### Lead source

Each contact form carries two hidden fields as its first children:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="lead_source" value="BP MS Lead">
<input type="hidden" name="Project Name" value="Brigade Banashankari">
```

`form-handler.js` sends the second as the lead's project (the Worker prints it as a
`Project:` line) and reads the first into the payload and the Worker stores it on the
record and prints it as a `Source:` line in both the Telegram message and the
email, so enquiries from different campaigns are told apart.

Three places, because both layers whitelist their fields - adding the input
alone would submit nothing:

| Change the value | `value="…"` in the ten pages with a contact form |
| --- | --- |
| Send a different field | `payload` in `site/js/form-handler.js` |
| Store or format it | `LIMITS`, `validate()`, `formatLead()` in `worker/index.js` |

The field is optional at every layer. A page cached before it existed, or
a page without it, still submits; the `Source:` line is simply
omitted. It is **not** the spam honeypot - that is a separate `company` field
injected by script and never stored. This one is a real submitted value.

Deliberately left without the field: `401.html` (Webflow's password gate, which
posts to `/.wf_auth`) and `style-guide.html` (the component reference page).
Neither produces a lead, and `form-handler.js` skips both.

Every form also carries a hidden Zone field, the project's zone as the PNZ MS
Leads sheet's Project Zone column names it:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="Zone" value="South Bangalore">
```

`form-handler.js` and the pop-up send it as `zone`; the Worker stores it and
prints a `Zone:` line under `Project:` in Telegram and email. A form without
it (a page cached before it was added) gets `SHEET_PROJECT.zone`. The sheet's
Project Zone column is always `SHEET_PROJECT.zone`, the same value, whatever a
form sends.

The zone also routes Telegram, as on every Bangalore microsite: the first bot
posts each lead to the South Bangalore group and to both All Bangalore groups
(`TELEGRAM_ZONE_CHATS` in `worker/index.js`). See Telegram below.

---

## Deploying

Do these in order. Storage and the status endpoint come before any
notification channel, so that when mail misbehaves you can already see what was
captured and what is configured.

### 1. KV namespace

Create it and paste the id into `wrangler.jsonc` (it reads
`REPLACE_WITH_KV_NAMESPACE_ID` until then). Named per project, matching the
other microsites on the account, because a Worker bound to the wrong namespace
would mix two clients' enquiries together.

```sh
npx wrangler kv namespace create brigade-banashankari-leads
```

Until a real id is in place `wrangler deploy` fails with
`KV namespace '…' is not valid [code: 10042]` - deliberately. A deploy that
succeeded without storage would put a live form in front of visitors with
nowhere to keep what they send.

### 2. Deploy

Via **Workers → Import a repository**:

- Production branch: this branch
- Build command: **empty** (nothing to build)
- Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`

Every push then redeploys. Confirm the site serves before going further.

### 3. Custom domain

**Workers → Settings → Domains & Routes → Add → Custom Domain**, for the apex
**and** `www`. You add no A or CNAME record yourself: Workers custom domains
require the zone on Cloudflare and Cloudflare writes the record.

`brigadebanashankari.org` is already yours and live (on `www`). Point the root domain
at this Worker and redirect `www` to it - every page's canonical points at the root.

### 4. Email

1. **Email Service → Email Routing** → enable for `brigadebanashankari.org`.
   Cloudflare adds MX, SPF and DKIM itself.
2. **Destination Addresses** → add the recipient → **click the verification
   link**. Mail will not send until this is done.

No routing *rule* is needed; those are for receiving. `LEAD_EMAIL_FROM` need not
be a real mailbox - only the domain must be onboarded - but replies to it
bounce, which is why it is `no-reply@`.

Mail to a verified Email Routing destination is free on every plan and counts
against no quota.

### 5. Telegram (optional)

```sh
npx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN   # the bot already in the Bangalore lead groups
```

The chats are fixed in the code, not set as a secret: the South Bangalore group and
both All Bangalore groups (`TELEGRAM_ZONE_CHATS` in `worker/index.js`), as on
every Bangalore microsite, so use the bot that is already a member of those
groups. After deploying, `/api/lead/status?check=telegram` asks Telegram, without
sending anything, whether the bot can post to each group; it answers
`"delivering":true` when all three are fine.

Always choose **Secret**, never a dashboard *Text* variable - plain-text
variables are owned by `wrangler.jsonc` and are wiped by the next deploy.

---

## Google Sheet

Every lead is also added to the shared **PNZ MS Leads** Google Sheet, beside
Telegram and email. Nothing needs setting for it: this Worker holds no URL or
secret. The `LEAD_SHEET` service binding in `wrangler.jsonc` calls the
`LeadSheet` entrypoint of the **assetz-mizu-ki** Worker in the same Cloudflare
account, which holds them and writes the row. `/api/lead/status` reports
`"sheet":{"configured":true}` once deployed.

The row's Page URL column is the full URL (`https://brigadebanashankari.org/price`),
which is how the shared sheet tells this site from the others. Every row also
names the project, the same whatever page or form the lead came from: Project
Name `Brigade Banashankari`, City `Bangalore`, Project Zone `South Bangalore`, Project
Status `Pre Launch`, Project Type `1, 2, 3 & 4 BHK Apartments` and Project Location
`Uttarahalli` (`SHEET_PROJECT` in `worker/index.js`). Lead City is the visitor's
city, as Cloudflare places them from their IP address: a guide, not an
address. Keep **assetz-mizu-ki** deployed under that
name: if it is ever renamed or deleted, leads here are still stored, emailed
and sent to Telegram, and only the sheet row is missed (the log says
`google sheet append threw`). Problems with the sheet itself are diagnosed
there: `https://assetz-mizu-ki.com/api/lead/status?check=sheet`.

```sh
node worker/sheet.test.mjs   # the sheet channel, no account needed
```

## Verifying

```sh
node worker/test.mjs        # 68 assertions, no account needed
```

After a deploy, through the edge cache - `cf-cache-status: HIT` will otherwise
serve a stale page and make a correct change look broken:

```sh
D=https://brigadebanashankari.org
C=$(date +%s)

curl -s "$D/?cb=$C" | md5sum; md5sum site/index.html   # deployed matches local
curl -s "$D/api/lead/status?cb=$C"                     # which channels are on
```

Then read the logs with `npx wrangler tail`. Every outcome is logged:

| Log line | Cause |
|---|---|
| `lead stored …` | saved to KV - always first |
| `email not configured; no recipient set` | `LEAD_EMAIL_TO` unset |
| `email send failed … not verified` | destination address never verified |
| `telegram config incomplete` | token without chat ids, or the reverse |
| `… status=400 chat not found` | wrong chat id, or Start never pressed |
| `… status=401` | token wrong or revoked |

Read captured leads in the dashboard under **Storage & Databases → KV → leads**.
Keys are `lead:<ISO timestamp>:<id>`, so they sort chronologically. There is
deliberately **no endpoint to read leads back**: an unauthenticated one would
publish every enquirer's name, email and phone number.

---

## Notes

**Recipient address.** `LEAD_EMAIL_TO` sits in `wrangler.jsonc` because this
repository is private. Neither it nor the sender reaches the browser. If the
repo is ever made public, delete that line and
`npx wrangler secret put LEAD_EMAIL_TO` instead - set one or the other, never
both.

**Phone validation is deliberately permissive.** The form is `type="tel"` with
no pattern, so a visitor abroad can type a country code that the browser
accepts. An Indian mobile is normalised to ten digits; any other 8–15 digit
number is kept rather than rejected, because losing an overseas enquiry costs
more than storing an odd number.

**Editing.** Every page is generated from one facts file, so a change to the
copy, a figure or a picture is best made as a rebuild, which carries it to
every page, the schema and the llms files at once. A one-off edit can go
straight into the HTML.

## Contact pop-up

`site/js/contact-popup.js` opens an enquiry form 8 seconds after the visitor
lands, once per browser session (not again on another page or after it is
closed). It closes on X, Esc or a click outside, and is a compact sheet at
the foot of the screen on phones. Its design follows the enquiry dialog on the DSR Ciel and Sri Tirumala
Legacy sites: a native `<dialog>` with name, phone and email, and a button
carrying the same classes as the contact form's.

It is loaded on every page except `401.html` by a deferred `<script>` tag, and
brings its own markup and styles.
Leads post to `/api/lead` with the same fields as `form-handler.js`, carrying
the page's own `lead_source` (or `LEAD_SOURCE` on a page without a form) and
a fixed message, since the Worker requires one.

It does not open once this browser has sent a lead, from the pop-up or the
page's own form (`form-handler.js` sets the same flag), over another open
dialog, or while the visitor is typing in a form on the page. `PROJECT`,
`LEAD_SOURCE`, `BUTTON_CLASS` and `DELAY_MS` are at the top of the file.

## Go-live checklist

`CLAUDE.md` is the standing microsite checklist this site was built and checked
against. What is left once the domain is connected (its phases 6 to 8):

1. Redirect `www.brigadebanashankari.org` to `brigadebanashankari.org` (a Cloudflare Redirect Rule).
2. Telegram: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` as a Worker secret, the bot already in the
   Bangalore lead groups; leads go to the South Bangalore group and both All Bangalore
   groups. `/api/lead/status?check=telegram` should answer `"delivering":true`.
3. Email Routing: verify the `LEAD_EMAIL_TO` destination address.
4. Google Search Console, once SSL is active: add the domain property, add the HTML
   tag and the HTML file to the site, then Verify.
5. Submit `sitemap.xml` and confirm it is read without errors.
6. Request indexing (about ten URLs a day): home, overview, FAQs, location, contact,
   then the rest.
7. Live test: submit the contact form and the pop-up, and confirm both reach Telegram
   and email with Project Name, Zone and Source = BP MS Lead.
8. Add the site to the tracker sheet under Bangalore, and link it from every other
   Bangalore microsite's "Do you have other projects in Bengaluru?" list.

## Speed

Every page was measured with Lighthouse (the engine behind PageSpeed Insights),
on a phone and a desktop profile, before delivery. Keep these in place when
editing:

- No jQuery and no webflow.js: Bootstrap's only script is the menu drawer,
  deferred, as are `form-handler.js` and the pop-up. Bootstrap's CSS is trimmed
  to the classes the pages use, and so is `site/css/site.css`.
- Pictures carry narrower copies (`-480`, `-720`) in their `srcset`, so a phone
  downloads one that fits, and an AVIF twin is offered first in a `<picture>`, with
  WebP as the fallback.
- The hero picture is fetched first (`fetchpriority="high"`), as is the first
  picture on the gallery page; pictures below the first screen load lazily.
- The latin files of the fonts the first screen uses are preloaded, and every
  face uses `font-display: swap`.
- Cloudflare compresses the HTML, CSS and JavaScript itself.

## Colour

White pages, a `#141919` charcoal header, key-figure band, gallery band and closing card, `#ffc30f` yellow circle arrows, figures and phone bar, `#006ebe` blue labels, a beige `#efeee4` amenities band and a light grey `#f7f7f7` footer.

The palette and type are Brigade's own, from brigadegroup.com: #141919 charcoal for
text, the header and the dark bands, the #ffc30f yellow of its circle arrows, dots and
key figures (never text on white: it is 1.5:1 there), #006ebe blue labels (#005a9c on
the beige), beige #efeee4 and grey #f7f7f7 bands and a light grey footer. Text is
Figtree, the closest free Google font to Brigade's licensed Proxima Nova. Every value
was contrast-measured before use.

The template was built dark, so the palette is repointed at its
source rather than rule by rule: the light-theme block at the end of
`site/css/site.css` redefines the export's own custom
properties, then overrides only the rules that hard-code a dark
background. Change `--riv-accent` there and every button, label, link,
table stripe and the lettermark follow. The generated tokens still read
`purple` and `gold` because those are Webflow's names; what they resolve
to is set in that block.

Contrast was measured rather than assumed - every rendered text element
across all 13 pages, none below WCAG AA. The favicon and apple-touch
icon are drawn from the same two values.

## Telegram notifications

The Worker posts every lead to Telegram as well as e-mail, routed by zone as on
every Bangalore microsite: to the South Bangalore group and to both All Bangalore
groups, whose chat ids are fixed in `TELEGRAM_ZONE_CHATS` in `worker/index.js`.
Only the token of the bot that is already in those groups is needed, set as a
Worker secret - not as a var in `wrangler.jsonc`, which would put it in the
repository:

```sh
# the argument is the NAME; the value is typed at the prompt
npx wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
```

Then open `/api/lead/status?check=telegram`: it asks Telegram, without sending
anything, whether the bot can post to each group, and answers
`"delivering":true` when it can. A group upgraded to a supergroup gets a new id;
the Worker follows it at once and logs the new id for `TELEGRAM_ZONE_CHATS`.
For local testing put the token in `.dev.vars`, which is already git-ignored.
A second and third bot can be added as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_2` /
`TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS_2` and `_3`; they post to their own chats.
Leads still reach e-mail, KV and the Google Sheet whether or not Telegram is set up.
